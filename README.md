I’m a self taught Full Stack Software Engineer who loves moving fast, wearing many hats, and collaborating with awesome people. I’ve worked with frontends using React and Vue, backends using Node.js and PHP, and cloud infrastructure using AWS. I’m looking to join my next small startup that is building the future.
