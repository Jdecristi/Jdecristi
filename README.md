# 👋 Hi My name is Joshua DeCristi

## Software Engineer

I'm a self-taught software engineer with a construction background. I fell in love with software after creating website for a local restaurant. I landed a junior role at Thumbstopper and later expanded my skills to include Vue.js, React, and Typescript. Through Formation, I've had the opportunity to learn from top engineers and mentor my peers. Today, I strive to work on projects I love, meet people smarter than me, and learn something new everyday!
